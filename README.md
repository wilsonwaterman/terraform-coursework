# Terraform Coursework
- Notes and examples from Edward Viaene's course on UDEMY
- Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-devops-infrastructure-automation-with-terraform/learn/lecture/5853788?start=0#overview

### demo-1
- Create an EC2 Instance
- Splitting provider, instance info, variables, and secrets into separate files and have them reference each other

### demo-2
- Create EC2 Instance
- Apply a ssh key pair generated by the user (.pem format must be used for the private key)
- Use provisioner tags to connect to instance and add shell script to install nginx
- This is effectively terraforms approach to "bootstrapping" and adding startup actions to an instance

### demo-2b
- Not included in notes
- Same as demo-2 but for windows instances
