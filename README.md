# Terraform Coursework
- Notes and examples from Edward Viaene's course on UDEMY
- Course: https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-devops-infrastructure-automation-with-terraform/learn/lecture/5853788?start=0#overview

### demo-1: Variables
- Create an EC2 Instance
- Splitting provider, instance info, variables, and secrets into separate files and have them reference each other

### demo-2: Software provisioning
- Create EC2 Instance
- Apply a ssh key pair generated by the user (.pem format must be used for the private key)
- Use provisioner tags to connect to instance and add shell script to install nginx
- This is effectively terraforms approach to "bootstrapping" and adding startup actions to an instance

### demo-2b: Software provisioning (Windows)
- Not included in notes
- Same as demo-2 but for windows instances

### demo-3: Outputting Variables
- Create an instance
- Send private ip to a text file using local-exec provisioner command
- Use output block to share public IP in terminal
- Key pair block not used, but can be added if you wanted to access the instance
